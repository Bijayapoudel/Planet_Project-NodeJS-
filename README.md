# Planet_Project(NodeJS)
1) Introduction

Welcome to the Exoplanet Habitat Finder! This Node.js project aims to help humanity find suitable exoplanets for survival by analyzing three key criteria: Exoplanet Archive Disposition, Insolation Flux (measured in Earth flux), and Planetary Radius (measured in Earth radii).


2) Getting Started

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Bijayapoudel/Planet_Project-NodeJS-/tree/master
Install dependencies: npm install
Run the app: npm start
Usage

The app allows you to input values for each of the three criteria, and will then return a list of exoplanets that meet those requirements. The exoplanet data is sourced from the NASA Exoplanet Archive.


3) Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project! If you'd like to make changes, please fork the repository and create a pull request.


4) Acknowledgments

NASA Exoplanet Archive for providing the exoplanet data
The OpenAI team for providing the language model used to generate this README.
